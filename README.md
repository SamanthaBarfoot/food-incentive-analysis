# Gender, Age, and Peer Influence in Food Incentive
## Abstract
This paper provides a detailed synthesis and replication of the original study, *Incentives and Unintended Consequences: Spillover Effects in Food Choice* (Angelucci et al. 2019). The original study involved 1631 students from a low-income area of Chicago, IL, aiming to examine spillover effects in incentivization. The study divided students into public and private treatments while exploring various factors such as grade, gender, and eligibility for free lunches. This paper's analysis delves into how these factors intersect with incentivization outcomes. Findings reveal nuanced influences; for instance, while gender had minimal impact on food choices, eligibility for free lunches materially influenced students' decisions, underscoring the role of socioeconomic factors.
